SOLUTION: PLC Connection Architecture Improvement

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Your Flask app is doing this pattern every 5 seconds:
1. PLCCommunicator() - create new instance
2. plc.connect() - connect to PLC  
3. plc.read_io() - read data
4. plc.disconnect() - disconnect from PLC
5. Event logger sees this as "PLC DISCONNECTED/CONNECTED"

This is inefficient and creates false connection events!

BETTER ARCHITECTURE:
1. Create ONE persistent PLC connection when Flask starts
2. Keep connection alive and reuse it for all reads
3. Only log REAL connection failures (not routine disconnects)
4. Add connection health monitoring with retry logic

BENEFITS:
✅ Faster reads (no connection overhead)
✅ More reliable (persistent connection)
✅ Accurate logging (only real failures)
✅ Better performance
✅ Less network traffic
