  "ai_summary": "Okay, here’s a concise technical analysis of the PLC data, focusing on the current state and potential issues:\n\nThe system is currently in a stable state with 90 total counts, 90 online, and 0 errors. Recent events indicate a series of ‘Out_A’ states, starting with ‘Out_A0_State’ and ‘Out_A1_State’, suggesting a potential process start.  It’s highly likely an ‘HMI_FaultReset’ event occurred around 20:35:27, followed by a ‘Stats_ForcingActive’ state being initiated, indicating a potential issue with a forced process.  We have 49 ‘active’ tags currently, and 0 are currently active.  The system is currently operating with 20 PWM duty cycles active, and 0 are currently active.\n\n"
