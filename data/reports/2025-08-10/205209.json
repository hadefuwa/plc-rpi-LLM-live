  "ai_summary": "Okay, here’s a concise technical analysis of the PLC data, focusing on the current state and potential issues:\n\nThe system is currently in a stable state with 90 total counts, 0 online, and 0 errors. Recent events indicate a series of “Out_AX” state transitions, starting with “Out_A0_State” and “Out_A1_State,” suggesting a potential automated process or sequence.  It’s highly likely an “E-Stop” occurred around 20:51:34, triggered by the “Out_A5_State” transition, likely involving a forced state change.  Currently, there are 49 “tags” active, and 10 are currently active, indicating a significant number of forcing operations are ongoing.\n\n"
