# 30-minute PLC Report

Okay, here’s a technical analysis of the PLC data, tailored for an operator report, focusing on the recent events and their implications:

**Summary:** The PLC system is currently in a state of controlled operation, with a focus on maintaining a safe and consistent process. Recent events indicate a steady state with minimal changes, primarily centered around the E-Stop monitoring system. The system is actively managing the HMI and other devices, with a focus on ensuring the safety of the process.

**Likely Occurrence:** The most likely scenario is that the PLC is currently operating within a pre-defined, safe state, likely a ‘forced’ state, as indicated by the ‘forced’ items. The recent events suggest a continuous monitoring and control of the HMI and related devices, potentially triggered by the E-Stop. The system is actively maintaining the status of the HMI and related devices, and is likely responding to the E-Stop by initiating a controlled shutdown.

**Emergency Stop:**  An Emergency Stop has likely occurred. The data shows a ‘forced’ state initiated by the E-Stop, immediately preceding the ‘forced’ state of the HMI, PWM0, and A0.  The system immediately initiated a shutdown to prevent potential harm.

**Observed IOs:** The data shows several IOs that appear to be forced, specifically the PWM0, PWM1, PWM0_High_Duty, PWM0_Low_Duty, PWM1_High_Duty, PWM1_Low_Duty, and A0_State, and A0_ForcedState. These are all explicitly marked as ‘forced’ and are likely being actively controlled by the PLC.
